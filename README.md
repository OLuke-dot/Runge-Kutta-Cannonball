# Runge Kutta Cannonball
This is a project in which by using 4th order Runge-Kutta method you can describe a motion of a cannonball fired at specific velocity
Project is written in C, and it can be hooked up to any graphical interface (I used WinBGI). Project can be also used for precise tracking in simulations.

#Initial Conditions
We assume, that the cannon ball is a <b>sphere</b> of radius <i>R</i>, and mass <i>m</i>, and it was fired with the initial velocity <i>V</i>, and angle <i>a</i>. We also assume some basic constants, such as acceleration <i>g</i>, density of the air (or any other medium, simulation will work in any other system) and drag coefficient
